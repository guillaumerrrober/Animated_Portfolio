Create a file called .prettierrc

Change the app.css files name with to App.scss and also in the file that calls it

Write the necessary code in the App.scss

Add the Assets folder into the src folder which contains the images etc.

You can now run the app with npm start to see if the app works

Now edit the index.css file to the right form

Edit the index.js too

Next edit App.js file by deleting initial code and writing the new code

Create a components folder for all the components in the src folder

In the components Folder create a folder called Layout

In the Layout create a file called index.js and index.scss

Write the necessary code in the newly created index.js and index.scss file

In the components folder create another folder called Sidebar and then create index files like was done before

The Layout (index.js) imports Sidebar

Now create a folder call Home in components folder and create the regular files needed

Write this code in the App.js file as a Route " <Route index element={<Home} />". I can't really explain what it will do for now 

create a new Folder called AnimatedLetters and create the regular files

Make sure that you put some animation in the letter of the name and job

Create other folders
